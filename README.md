We have submitted two ipython notebooks.

-The first notebook contains the basic aim of this project which was specified
 in the homework pdf. It also contains our blog which we have written in the 
 form of markdown cells in the notebook.

- Extra credit writeup is also written in this notebook along with codes for
  some parts of the extra credit.

- The English and French files have mainly been used for this ipython notebook.

- The second notebook contains one part of the extra credit namely, the 
  multiclass classification. The Dutch and Portugese files have been used in this
  book.
