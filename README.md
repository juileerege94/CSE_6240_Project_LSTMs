# CSE_6240_Project_LSTMs
Two language detection models: English and French. 

The aim is to create two language detection models, one for English and one for French. Take in the input text files and divide into training and testing parts. Create two LSTM models and train them using the data. Compare the probability of detection of each test string in each of the models; it is classified as the model that gives the higher probability.

Various extra credit extensions are also performed such as

- testing with larger dataset
- testing with variation in model parameters
- testing with bidirectional model
- testing with more languages
